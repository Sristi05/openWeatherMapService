# openWeatherMapService

Download node js from the internet and install in the system.
then we must use this command in commad line to download the request package for node js

npm install request --save

we can save the app in any folder
after going into the folder in command line
run the application like if my application is in c:/programs then,

c:/program>node weatherapp.js    ------press enter

the program will ask the city name , on based of city name it will provide temperature for that city.
if city name is incorrect, it will respond accordingly

I have used 5 API keys each has 5 limit in an hour.
so if all API has been used it will not let you ask more request.
it will ask you to wait for some time and exit the program.
